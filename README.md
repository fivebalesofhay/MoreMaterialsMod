To install, download The Bibites version 0.5.1 and replace "The Bibites_data/Managed/BibitesAssembly.dll" with the file found here, and replace "The Bibites_data/Mods" with the folder found here. Optionally, you may place the two bibites and scenario in the game's save folders. This mod saves all data to a folder called "ModData" that should appear in the old save location once you've run the game.

Because the game uses a new save location, you will not be able to access your old saves unless you move them into ModData.

This mod adds two new materials: fruit and wood. Wood is food for herbivores, and fruit is for omnivores, and is most effective at a diet value of 0.5.
